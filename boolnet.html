<h1>Boolean network visualization</h1>
Our goal for this idea is to visualize a Boolean Simulation on a reaction
network inside the biographer component developed in last year's GSoC.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
Boolean networks are a simplified way to describe regulatory networks. According to this
simplification, species can only have two states,
either active or inactive. It has been shown in various approaches that Boolean
networks can reproduce experimental behavior of biological systems while still
being simple to handle and computationally less challenging than for instance
ordinary differential equation models.
</p>
<p>
In order to graphically represent the evolution of reaction networks over time,
we will integrate a tool into the existing biographer software which creates a
Boolean network from the the reaction graph by an automated model generation
algorithm (like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/libscopes/">libScopes</a>) and which subsequently simulates it. The Boolean network and
the reaction graph will be synchronized in a way that modifications on the
reaction graph are automatically applied to the Boolean network which thus can
be modified interactively.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, biographer already includes a possibility to directly load Boolean
networks from the existing package <a href="http://code.google.com/p/booleannet/">booleannet</a>. This will be extended to other
packages like R's <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-ulm.de/ni/mitarbeiter/HKestler/boolnet/">BoolNet</a> and libScopes. This direct import however requires a
visualization to be created from the Boolean network data automatically (i.e.
the other way around as mentioned above). In particular, Boolean
networks are best represented by the <a href="http://www.sbgn.org/">SBGN</a> activity flow standard which also
includes symbols for the logical functions like AND or OR. The biographer
component has to be extended accordingly.
</p>
<p>
The generated Boolean network together with its  initial conditions will be
submitted to the server for the calculations of the simulation. The approach
will start with deterministic synchronous Boolean models but can also be
extended to asynchronous or probabilistic Boolean networks.

<ol>
<li> Based on existing Boolean simulation tools (e.g. booleannet in python or
BoolNet in R)
<li> Automated generation of a Boolean network from defined reaction networks by
