This site gives you an overview about the project opportunities at the
biographer project. We offer projects in the field of network 
layout, web interface design and boolean network simulation. The main code
languages used are JavaScript, Python and C++.
</p>


<h1>About biographer</h1>

<p>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/biographer/">biographer</a> aims at providing a standard library for the in-browser visualization
of biological reaction networks with.
an optional automated layout. 

</p>
<p>
biographer has been started during last year's Google Summer of Code in the
<a href="http://www2.hu-berlin.de/biologie/theorybp/">Theoretical Biophysics Group</a> at Humboldt University.
It matured into a JavaScript library generating a SVG representation of such
networks. Apart from the automatic layout which is optimized for 
reaction networks it features an editor component for network modifications and
a server component which 
allows the import from various sources of biological networks, including the
<a href="http://www.reactome.org/">Reactome</a> database and <a href="http://sbml.org/">SBML</a> files. 

</p>
<p>
Visualizations follow the <a href="http://www.sbgn.org/">SBGN</a> standard which defines how reaction networks
should be graphically represented.
This includes structured nodes which visualize the composition of protein
complexes, different edge types for 
the various participant roles in biochemical reactions and various node types
representing the different biochemical entities
which can interact in a cellular environment.
</p>

<h1> About the group</h1>
<p>
The <a href="http://www2.hu-berlin.de/biologie/theorybp/">Theoretical Biophysics group</a> pursues scientific research in the field of
Systems Biology by the means of mathematical and computational models. We aim to
develop new techniques, software, incorporate new and well established knowledge
to get a better understanding of the fundamentals of life. In particular, we
focus on biological processes in Yeast, Bacillus subtilis and mammalian cells.
</p>
<p>
As vivid users of open source software we are also eagerly committed to feeding
back to the community by conceiving and implementing new <a href="http://www2.hu-berlin.de/biologie/theorybp/index.php?goto=tools">software tools</a> or
participating in existing projects. Details on our software activities can be
found here. The listed tools are used by a large community of biologists of
different specializations, including metabolism, signaling and dynamical
modeling.  
</p>
<p>
Since we are a university research group, we do teaching on a daily bases. In
addition to lecturing this also includes the mentoring of a graduate students
during thesis preparation. Our GSoC students will strongly profit from this
experience when working on one of our project proposals.
</p>

<h1>Proposed Ideas</h1>
<p>
This year we again proposed a list of ideas which extend the functionality of biographer. The focus will be 
on widening the audience by implementing interfaces to public database resources, creating a pad version and extending to
further dialects of the SBGN standard.
</p>
<h2>Idea 1. Build a front-end for the public databases WikiPathway and Reactome</h2>

<h2>Idea 2. Create a pad version of biographer</h2>

<h2><a href="boolnet.html">Idea 3. Add a Boolean Network modeling tool</a></h2>

<h2>Idea 4. Extend layout to SBGN-ER formalism</h2>

<h2>Idea 5. Implement a Grid-based layout in JavaScript</h2>

<h2>Idea 6. Make a client-side version of the layout module using Google Native Client</h2>


<h1>Biological reaction networks</h1>
</p>
Systems Biology is a field in Biology which studies the components and its
interactions of a biological system as a whole. In the view of Systems Biology,
systems show emergent properties which are due to the complex interplay of the
components and which were not visible by investigating the components
individually.
</p>
<p>
Part of our research activities center around the creation and analysis of
biological reaction networks. These networks provide intuitive views of
interactions underlying biological processes which play a role in metabolism or
signalling. By investigating these networks deep insights can be gained into the
principles of cellular function and diseases like for example cancer.
A typical signaling pathway can represent receptor-binding events, protein
complexes, phosphorylation reactions, translocations and transcriptional
regulation, with only a minimal set of symbols, lines and arrows. These powerful
representations are essential tools, common among the textbooks and review
articles that document any given field of biology.
</p>
<p>
Within that context, the visualization of biological networks is a major point
of interest. For a given, small to medium scale network a manual layout may be
the best choice. Tools for this task exist, the most famous representative is
certainly <a href="http://www.celldesigner.org/">CellDesigner</a>. Nevertheless, creating a manual layout is time consuming
and is generally only worth the effort for a well prepared network subject to
publication.
</p>
<p>
With the advent of electronic databases of biological networks (<a href="http://www.kegg.jp/">KEGG</a>, <a href="http://www.reactome.org/">Reactome</a>),
in principle a large number of network candidates can be generated, creating the
need for automated layouts for the subsequent evaluation and analysis. A lot of
software packages for automated graph layout exist, among the most prominent are
<a href="http://graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a> and <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</a>. Most packages are quite general with respect to the type
of graph they accept. This, of course, opens a wide range of possible
applications.
</p>
<p>
The reaction networks mentioned before, however, represent a special kind of
graph. Specific features include the existence of reactions and metabolites as
special node types, the different meaning of substrate, product and modulator
edges of reactions and the optional locality information. These particularities
justify layout algorithms optimized for this type of graph.

<h1>Guide to students</h1>
<ol>
<li>We are seeking eager and highly skilled students willing to contribute to open
source in a research environment. Interest in biological or medical engineering
is a strong plus.
<li>We recommend you that you contact us already before you send in your
application. In this way you can obtain more information and we can also help
you with your submission.
<li>Apart from the ideas presented above we are open to suggestions from students.
If you would like to contribute an idea to the project please include a detailed
description of it in your application.
<li>Your application should include a statement of interest (why do you want to
participate), a project proposal (following one of our ideas or an independent
idea) with preliminary timeline, as well as your CV stressing on your
experiences. Please note, the knowledge of the computer languages (C/C++, perl,
python or JS) are a prerequisite.
<li>Take one of the tests or provide relevant code examples. Although we do not
require you to complete the test, doing so may increase the chances of your
application.
<li>Applications to one of our offered projects go through the Google Summer of Code
website (<a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012">http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012</a>). There you can find all information about
the admission. Please note that the application window is open only from March
26 to April 6, 2011.
<li>Google grants a stipend to the accepted students. This comes along with the
liability to proceed as described in the project proposal. Google requires us to
report on your overall progress. For the projects mentioned above you can expect
about 1.5 months of full-time work between May 23 and August 30.
Please check the <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2012/faqs">FAQ</a> 
and <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2012/userguide">User Guide</a> on the google website for application
advise.
