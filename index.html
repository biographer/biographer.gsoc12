This site gives you an overview about the project opportunities at the
biographer project. We offer projects in the field of network 
layout, web interface design and boolean network simulation. The main code
languages used are JavaScript, Python and C++.
</p>


<h1>About biographer</h1>

<p>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/biographer/">biographer</a> aims at providing a standard library for the in-browser visualization
of biological reaction networks with.
an optional automated layout. 

</p>
<p>
biographer has been started during last year's Google Summer of Code in the
<a href="http://www2.hu-berlin.de/biologie/theorybp/">Theoretical Biophysics Group</a> at Humboldt University.
It matured into a JavaScript library generating a SVG representation of such
networks. Apart from the automatic layout which is optimized for 
reaction networks it features an editor component for network modifications and
a server component which 
allows the import from various sources of biological networks, including the
<a href="http://www.reactome.org/">Reactome</a> database and <a href="http://sbml.org/">SBML</a> files. 

</p>
<p>
Visualizations follow the <a href="http://www.sbgn.org/">SBGN</a> standard which defines how reaction networks
should be graphically represented.
This includes structured nodes which visualize the composition of protein
complexes, different edge types for 
the various participant roles in biochemical reactions and various node types
representing the different biochemical entities
which can interact in a cellular environment.
</p>

<h1> About the group</h1>
<p>
The <a href="http://www2.hu-berlin.de/biologie/theorybp/">Theoretical Biophysics group</a> pursues scientific research in the field of
Systems Biology by the means of mathematical and computational models. We aim to
develop new techniques, software, incorporate new and well established knowledge
to get a better understanding of the fundamentals of life. In particular, we
focus on biological processes in Yeast, Bacillus subtilis and mammalian cells.
</p>
<p>
As vivid users of open source software we are also eagerly committed to feeding
back to the community by conceiving and implementing new <a href="http://www2.hu-berlin.de/biologie/theorybp/index.php?goto=tools">software tools</a> or
participating in existing projects. Details on our software activities can be
found here. The listed tools are used by a large community of biologists of
different specializations, including metabolism, signaling and dynamical
modeling.  
</p>
<p>
Since we are a university research group, we do teaching on a daily bases. In
addition to lecturing this also includes the mentoring of a graduate students
during thesis preparation. Our GSoC students will strongly profit from this
experience when working on one of our project proposals.
</p>

<h1>Proposed Ideas</h1>
<p>
This year we again proposed a list of ideas which extend the functionality of biographer. The focus will be 
on widening the audience by implementing interfaces to public database resources, creating a pad version and extending to
further dialects of the SBGN standard.

<h2>Idea 1. Build a front-end for the public databases WikiPathway and Reactome</h2>

<h2>Idea 2. Create a pad version of biographer</h2>

<h2><a href="boolnet.html">Idea 3. Add a Boolean Network modeling tool</a></h2>

<h2>Idea 4. Extend layout to SBGN-ER formalism</h2>

<h2>Idea 5. Implement a Grid-based layout in JavaScript</h2>

<h2>Idea 6. Make a client-side version of the layout module using Google Native Client</h2>
