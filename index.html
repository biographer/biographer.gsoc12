This site gives you an overview about the project opportunities at the biographer project. We offer projects in the field of network 
layout, web interface design and boolean network simulation. The main code languages used are Javascript, Python and C++.

<h1>About biographer</h1>

<p>
biographer aims at providing a standard library for the in-browser visualization of biological reaction networks with.
an optional automated layout. 

</p>
<p>
biographer has been started during last year's Google Summer of Code in the Theoretical Biophyisics Group at Humboldt University.
It matured into a javascript library generating a SVG representation of such networks. Apart from the automatic layout which is optimized for 
reaction networks it features an editor component for network modifications and a server component which 
allows the import of various source for biological networks, including the Reactome database or SBML files. 

</p>
<p>
Visualizations follow the SBGN standard which defines how reaction networks should be graphically represented.
This includes structured nodes which visualize the composition of protein complexes, different edge types for 
the varios participant roles in biochemical reactions and various node types representing the different biochemical entities
which can interact in a cellular environment.

<h1> About the group</h1>
<p>
The Theoretical Biophysics group pursues scientific research in the field of Systems Biology by the means of mathematical and computational models. We aim to develop new techniques, software, incorporate new and well established knowledge to get a better understanding of the fundamentals of life. In particular, we focus on biological processes in Yeast, Bacillus subtilis and mammalian cells.
</p>
<p>
As vivid users of open source software we are also eagerly committed to feeding back to the community by conceiving and implementing new software tools or participating in existing projects. Details on our software activities can be found here. The listed tools are used by a large community of biologists of different specializations, including metabolism, signalling and dynamical modelling.  
</p>
<p>
Since we are a university research group, we do teaching on a daily bases. In addition to lecturing this also includes the mentoring of a graduate students during thesis preparation. Our GSoC student will strongly profit from this experience when working on one of our project proposals.
