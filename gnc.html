<h1>Client side layout using Google Native Client</h1>

<p>
biographer's layout component has been written in C++ for speed reasons. 
This requires the layout calculation to be performed on the server. This is not a problem as long as 
only a few users request network layouts at a time. However, in order to be prepared for future 
applications of biographer we would like provide options for client-side layout calculations.

As a JavaScript port will most likely be too slow for interactive network generation, we propose to use 
Google Native Client to run biographer's C++ code on the client. Google Native Client can run compiled code
from a list of coding languages (inlcuding C++) in the Google Chrome Browser. This feature is still under development
but chances are good that also other browser will support this or a similar interface at some point.

<h2>Core specification</h2>
<ol>
  <li> compile biographer's layout algorithm  for the use with GNC
  <li> implement message handling on the javaScript and C++ side
  <li> performance improvements to the layout algorithm
</ol>
