<h1>Student Tests</h1>

  <p>
  These tests address your programming skills needed 
  for our project proposals. We offer tests for C/C++ <b>OR</b> javascript. Please take the 
  one which fits to your application (i.e. the idea you are applying to). These tests are rather 
  easy and should not take you much time.
  </p><p>
  Please note that we do not require you to take these 
  test in order to send in an application. Doing some may however increase your chances. 
  </p><p>  
  These test will asses your general ability to work with the corresponding language. Clearly,
  if you have previously worked on open source projects, such code might provide a better view on your abilities.
  Hence, you can alternatively provide short, but instructive code samples from past projects with
  your application. In this case, the tests will be just for fun (-;

  <h3>C/C++ Test</h3>
  <p>
  Write a small C/C++ program which calculates for each node of the given
  example graph the number of neighbors and the number of neighbors of neighbors.
  You can use simple C array structures or use a popular graph library.
  </p><p>  
  
  Please note that the code is important, not the result. The graph can be hardcoded
  into the code, though. I would be nice to see some generic structures like functions returning the
  neighbors of a node.
</p>
  
  <h3>Javascript Test</span></h3>
  Extend the code for creating and moving elements in an SVG image found
  <a href="http://srufaculty.sru.edu/david.dailey/svg/makeDragDrop.svg">here</a> by enabling the user to
  insert edges (straight lines from center to center) between nodes. These edges should move together with
  the nodes when they are dragged.
 
  </p><p>
  Alternatively you may create your own implementation where nodes and edges 
  can be added by for example left or right clicking. Just be creative. The code counts!
