<h1>Reactome / WikiPathways Integration</h1>



<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>

Our primary goal when developing biographer in first place was to create a
software component which can visualize reaction networks without manual
intervention. The visualization follows the SBGN standard which defines the
symbolics that should be used for this type of networks. Clearly, the next step
would be to connect this component to the sources of such networks, large
biological reaction databases, among which Reactome and WikiPathways belong to
the most popular. 
</p>
<p>

These databases contain information on reactions between thousands of compounds
(i.e. proteins, chemical species, complexes, nucleotide sequences). To make this
amount of information more accessible to the users, network diagrams are
provided which visualize the connections between the different entities. These
visualizations are usually limited to manual laid out diagrams of single
biological pathways, modules in the network which are functionally strongly
related. 
</p>
<p>

Here, we propose a more generic way of visualizing networks using the biographer
component. Arbitrary parts of the complete network, which could be the
aforementioned pathways or the neighborhoods of any compound, are visualized
automatically in a SBGN compliant manner. 
</p>
<p>

Furthermore, the integrated editor functionality of biographer could be used to
propose/post corrections to the underlying network data or allow the user to
download modified versions of the pathways.
