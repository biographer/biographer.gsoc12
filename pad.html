<h1>Tablet and gesture support for the visualization</h1>

<p>
  During the last Google Summer of Code (GSoC 2011), a JavaScript library for
  interactive reaction graphs was developed. Currently, this library makes
  use of Scalable Vector Graphics for rendering, as well as HTML to support
  editing. The library and tooling around it, i.e., an editor, are focused on
  traditional input peripherals. Mouse and keyboard are used in combination
  to activate certain features like modification of node dimensions and
  position.
</p>

<p>
  In the recent years, new peripherals and devices like tablets became popular
  and widely used. With the help of these devices, we hope to change and
  simplify the way users interact with visualizations. For instance, a tablet
  could be used in meetings to control a presentation or in locations where
  desktop computers or notebooks are not an option or to cumbersome, for
  instance, on the train.
</p>

<p>
  For this Google Summer of Code, we hope to find a student who is interested in
  implementing support for common tablets and gestures. Ideally, the application
  wouldn't need to be ported to a native application, but instead executed in
  the users' browsers as a web application thus facilitating the already
  existing library.
</p>

<h2>Core specification</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Improve performance of the visualization by deferring activation of
    editing support.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rendering of visualization on (common) touchscreen devices, especially on
    smartphones and tablets.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support for basic panning / scrolling and zooming.
  </li>
  <li>
    Usage of gestures to replace or improve desktop application input
    mechanism, especially with respect to navigation in a graph, for instance,
    by clicking (tapping) on a node, and changing of node dimensions and
    positions.
  </li>
</ol>
